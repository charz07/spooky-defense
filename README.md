<h1 align="left">Spooky Defense</h1>
A halloween-themed single player game written in Java.\nThis game was my first major coding project to test my Java skills.

<h1>Gameplay</h1>
Players use obstacles to block the path of various monsters and guide halloween monsters towards a trap to win. Several character selections and monsters allow for diversified gameplay.
